# uniform_gammas_extractor

## Overview 

`uniform_gamma_extractor` is a Python-based tool designed to process large .tgz archives of data files by extracting and organizing the contents into designated directories based on predefined file naming patterns developed for the EXO-200 collaboration (specifically contributing to the exo-deep group). The tool organize files with gamma event simulation data for future studies involving machine learning models with Neural Networks. The code is designed to be flexible, allowing easy adaptation to handle other datasets or archives with similar requirements.

This project extracts specific files from a `.tgz` archive containing gamma-related datasets.  
Only files within the `uniform_gammas/` directory are extracted and categorized into four groups based on their naming patterns.

## Features

- Efficient Extraction: Handles large `.tgz` archives without fully unpacking them, minimizing memory usage.
- Custom File Organization: Categorizes extracted files into directories based on user-defined naming patterns.
- Logging: Tracks progress and logs output to both the terminal and a log file.
- Performance Monitoring: Displays and records the time taken to extract and save each file.
